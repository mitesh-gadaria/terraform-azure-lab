# Terraform Azure Learning Project

## Overview
This is a beginner-friendly personal project created to support my transition from a Quality Assurance role into a Junior DevOps position.  
The goal of this repository is to demonstrate hands-on learning with Infrastructure as Code (IaC), cloud resources, and version control using Git.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Git & GitHub (version control, commits, remote repositories)
- Terraform (Infrastructure as Code fundamentals)
- Microsoft Azure (cloud resource provisioning)
- CI/CD and automation concepts
- DevOps and infrastructure learning mindset

## Project Roadmap
This project will gradually include:
- Terraform configuration files to provision Azure resources
- Use of variables and outputs
- Infrastructure changes tracked through Git commits
- Documentation explaining design decisions and learning outcomes

## About Me
